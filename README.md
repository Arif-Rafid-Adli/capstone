### Background Fact
The blood transfusion process in several regions in Indonesia currently still requires the development of digital facilities, especially  in the process of requesting and distributing blood: the patient’s families still need to bring the blood sample from the hospital to the blood transfusion unit and then find blood donors by themselves and it can take several hours or even days.

### Reason
The Process of blood transfusion need to be  decentralized, which in turn reduces complexity and enables faster response time to those in need. This is the base concept of our application and further development is possible.

### Solution
We are providing an application for hospital or blood transfusion unit as admin and application for donors as user. Our app’s features:
* Emergency notification
* User Profile and donor history
