### Background Fact
The blood transfusion process in several regions in Indonesia currently still requires the development of digital facilities, especially  in the process of requesting and distributing blood: the patientâ€™s families still need to bring the blood sample from the hospital to the blood transfusion unit and then find blood donors by themselves and it can take several hours or even days.
